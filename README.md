Generate a gulpfile for your project.

## What is generate?

Generate is a new, open source developer framework for rapidly initializing and scaffolding out new code projects, offering an intuitive CLI, and a powerful and expressive API that makes it easy and enjoyable to use.

Visit the [getting started guide](https://github.com/generate/getting-started) or the [generate](https://github.com/generate/generate/docs/cli.install.md) project and documentation to learn more.

## CLI

To use this generator, you will first need to [install generate's CLI](https://github.com/generate/generate/docs/cli.install.md){docs/cli.install.md}.

**Install generate-gulpfile globally**

```sh
$ npm install --global generate-gulpfile
```

**Command line usage**

You should now be able to run this generator's `default` task with the following command:

```sh
$ gen gulpfile
# or
$ gen gulpfile:default
```

## API

**Install generate-gulpfile locally**

```sh
$ npm install --save generate-gulpfile
```

**Plugin usage**

```js
module.exports = function(app) {
  app.use(require('generate-gulpfile'));
};
```

**Sub-generator usage**

Register `generate-gulpfile` as a sub-generator in your own generator:

```js
module.exports = function(app) {
  app.register('foo', require('generate-gulpfile'));
};
```

Where `foo` is any arbitrary name for the sub-generator. See generate's [getting started guide](https://github.com/generate/getting-started) for more details.

## CLI

**Installing the CLI**

To run the `gulpfile` generator from the command line, you'll need to install [generate](https://github.com/generate/generate/docs/cli.install.md) globally first. You can do that now with the following command:

```sh
$ npm i -g generate
```

This adds the `gen` command to your system path, allowing it to be run from any directory.

**Help**

Get general help and a menu of available commands:

```sh
$ gen help
```

**Running the `gulpfile` generator**

Once both [generate](https://github.com/generate/generate/docs/cli.install.md) and `generate-gulpfile` are installed globally, you can run the generator with the following command:

```sh
$ gen gulpfile
```

If completed successfully, you should see both `starting` and `finished` events in the terminal, like the following:

```sh
[00:44:21] starting ...
...
[00:44:22] finished ✔
```

If you do not see one or both of those events, please [let us know about it](../../issues).

## API

This updater can also be used as a node.js library in your own updater. To do so you must first install generate-gulpfile locally.

**Install**

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
$ npm install --save generate-gulpfile
```

**Use as a plugin in your generator**

Use as a plugin if you want to extend your own generator with the features, settings and tasks of generate-gulpfile, as if they were created on your generator.

In your `generator.js`:

```js
module.exports = function(app) {
  app.use(require('generate-gulpfile'));

  // specify any tasks from generate-gulpfile. Example:
  app.task('default', ['gulpfile']);
};
```

**Use as a sub-generator**

Use as a sub-generator if you want expose the features, settings and tasks from generate-gulpfile on a _namespace_ in your generator.

In your `generator.js`:

```js
module.exports = function(app) {
  // register the generate-gulpfile generator (as a sub-generator with an arbitrary name)
  app.register('foo', require('generate-gulpfile'));

  app.task('minify', function(cb) {
    // minify some stuff
    cb();
  });

  // run the "default" task on generate-gulpfile (aliased as `foo`), 
  // then run the `minify` task defined in our generator
  app.task('default', function(cb) {
    app.generate(['foo:default', 'minify'], cb);
  });
};
```

Tasks from `generate-gulpfile` will be available on the `foo` namespace from the API and the command line. Continuing with the previous code example, to run the `default` task on `generate-gulpfile`, you would run `gen foo:default` (or just `gen foo` if `foo` does not conflict with an existing task on your generator).
